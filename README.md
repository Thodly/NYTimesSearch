# Project 2 - *NYTimesSearch*

**NYTimesSearch** is an android app that allows a user to search for articles on web using simple filters. The app utilizes [New York Times Search API](http://developer.nytimes.com/docs/read/article_search_api_v2).

Time spent: **14** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [X] User can **search for news article** by specifying a query and launching a search. Search displays a grid of image results from the New York Times Search API.
* [X] User can click on "settings" which allows selection of **advanced search options** to filter results
* [X] User can configure advanced search filters such as:
  * [X] Begin Date (using a date picker)
  * [X] News desk values (Arts, Fashion & Style, Sports)
  * [X] Sort order (oldest or newest)
* [X] Subsequent searches have any filters applied to the search results
* [X] User can tap on any article in results to view the contents in an embedded browser.
* [X] User can **scroll down to see more articles**. The maximum number of articles is limited by the API search.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Implements robust error handling, [check if internet is available](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Sending-and-Managing-Network-Requests#checking-for-network-connectivity), handle error cases, network failures
* [X] Used the **ActionBar SearchView** or custom layout as the query box instead of an EditText
* [ ] User can **share an article link** to their friends or email it to themselves
* [ ] Replaced Filter Settings Activity with a lightweight modal overlay
* [X]Improve the user interface and experiment with image assets and/or styling and coloring (1 to 3 points depending on the difficulty of UI improvements)
